Git merge and rebase are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they achieve this in fundamentally different ways, impacting the commit history.
Use Cases of Merge :Integrating long-lived feature branches into a main or develop branch.When you want to maintain a clear record of when and how branches were combined When working on a shared branch where rewriting history would be disruptive to other collaborators.
Use Cases of Rebase : Cleaning up your local feature branch before merging it into a shared branch to present a tidy history. Integrating upstream changes into your local feature branch without creating unnecessary merge commits When you want a perfectly linear project history.
Merging is a safe option that preserves the entire history of your repository, while rebasing creates a linear history by moving your feature branch onto the tip of main .
History of Rebase: Creates a linear history by rewriting commits. The original commits on the feature branch are replaced with new ones, resulting in a cleaner, more streamlined commit graph.
History of Merge: Preserves the complete and accurate history of all branches, including the branching and merging points. The commit graph will show a non-linear history with branches converging.
